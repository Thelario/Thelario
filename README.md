<h3>Hello there!</h3>

- I've published Project Romboid on Steam, a hard arcade roguelite shooter made with Unity & C#.
- I am currently learning about c++ and game engines (I am trying to create my own engine).
- I have been working with unity and c# for 5+ years.
- I love videogames, programming and reading.
