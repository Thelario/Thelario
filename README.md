<h3>Hello there!</h3>

- I recently finnished a 2D rogue-like game in Unity called Shootingat Resolved.
- I am currently learning about c++ and game engines (I am trying to create my own engine).
- I am also doing a game of minigames, inspired by Wario Ware and Pureya, but with a casual style and for mobile phones.
- I have been working with unity and c# for 3+ years.
- I love videogames, programming and reading.
