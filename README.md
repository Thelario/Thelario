<h3>Hello there!</h3>

- I recently finnished a 2D rogue-like game in Unity called Shootingat Resolved, and I am working on updates at the moment.
- I am currently learning about c++ and game engines (I am trying to create my own engine).
- I am also doing a tutorial series in YouTube (in Spanish) about how to make a top-down roguelike shooter game in Unity.
- I have been working with unity and c# for 3+ years.
- I love videogames, programming and reading.
